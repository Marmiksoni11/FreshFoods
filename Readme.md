------------------ FOR SMIT ------------------------

### SMIT TODOS : 

    1) The Login Form is already created you only have to do designing
    
    2) Create a Register page (BACKEND ALREADY CREATED)
    
    3) A User should not be Able to hit a URL in CHROME only if the user is logged in 
    example, hit the following URL : http://localhost:3000/home.html 
    this url should not open if the user is not logged in like wise OTHER PAGES AS WELL ! 


----------------------- ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS ------------------------------

### About Login API : 

   --- >  WHEN YOU DO LOGIN MAKE SURE TO REGISTER WITH THE ACCOUNT FIRST

### About Register API : 

   --- >  WHEN YOU DO Register MAKE SURE TO KEEP THE EMAIL UNIQUE FOR EVERY REGISTER OR ELSE IT WILL THROW THE 'DUPLICATE' ERROR , as the emails in the database have to be UNIQUE
